# News Category Prediction with Instruction Tuning Llama 7B

Welcome to my project, where I guide you through the process of fine-tuning Meta’s Llama 2 7B model for classifying news articles into 18 categories. In this repository, you will find a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial to fine-tune any large language model (LLM) using a custom dataset.

## Why Fine-Tune Llama 2?

The Llama 2 7B model, a powerful pre-trained language model by Meta, is designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By fine-tuning it on specific datasets, like news articles across different categories, you can improve its ability to perform nuanced tasks like news categorization. This project focuses on making this fine-tuning process accessible, efficient, and scalable using the latest techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, I’ll walk you through the entire process, from setting up the environment to fine-tuning the model and deploying it. The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Setup and Preparation
- Installing necessary libraries and tools to fine-tune the model
- Setting up Hugging Face and Meta’s Llama 2 to work with the dataset
- Preprocessing the news articles dataset for model fine-tuning

### Part 2: Fine-Tuning and Open-Sourcing
- Fine-tuning the model using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with QLoRA
- Saving the fine-tuned model and pushing it to the Hugging Face Hub for public access

## Features
- **Step-by-step tutorial**: Learn each part of the process, explained in detail with code snippets and explanations.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Using PEFT and QLoRA, this project minimizes computational costs while maintaining high performance.
- **Dataset**: A custom dataset of news articles, categorized into 18 different topics, for effective training.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Access to Llama 2 7B model (via Hugging Face or Meta)
- Access to a suitable environment (Google Colab, local server, etc.)
