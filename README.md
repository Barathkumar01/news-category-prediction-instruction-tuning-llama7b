# news-category-prediction-instruction-tuning-llama7b

Welcome to my project, where I guide you through the process of fine-tuning Meta’s Llama 2 7B model for classifying news articles into 18 categories. In this repository, you will find a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial to fine-tune any large language model (LLM) using a custom dataset.

Why Fine-Tune Llama 2?

The Llama 2 7B model, a powerful pre-trained language model by Meta, is designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By fine-tuning it on specific datasets, like news articles across different categories, you can improve its ability to perform nuanced tasks like news categorization. This project focuses on making this fine-tuning process accessible, efficient, and scalable using the latest techniques.

Project Overview

In this project, I’ll walk you through the entire process, from setting up the environment to fine-tuning the model and deploying it. The project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Setup and Preparation

Installing necessary libraries and tools to fine-tune the model
Setting up Hugging Face and Meta’s Llama 2 to work with the dataset
Preprocessing the news articles dataset for model fine-tuning

Part 2: Fine-Tuning and Open-Sourcing

Fine-tuning the model using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with QLoRA
Saving the fine-tuned model and pushing it to the Hugging Face Hub for public access

Features

Step-by-step tutorial: Learn each part of the process, explained in detail with code snippets and explanations.

Efficient Fine-Tuning: Using PEFT and QLoRA, this project minimizes computational costs while maintaining high performance.

Dataset: A custom dataset of news articles, categorized into 18 different topics, for effective training.
